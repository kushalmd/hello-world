# hello-world
My first repository
I believe technology has to be intuitive, efficient,useful and fun.

My primary aim is to ease everyday life of people and enterprise by providing a genuine solution based on technical and functional knowledge.I enjoy designing the information to be efficaciously sensible and thoughtfully perceptive. 

I am a keen follower of Industrial management and Engineering management practices.

Data analytics, quality control, extracting information for decision making are my key areas of interests.
